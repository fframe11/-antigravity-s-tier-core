# Python Clean Architecture

Provide Clean Architecture guidance for Python projects, specifically FastAPI APIs. Based on seven core design principles, Pythonic implementations of classic patterns, and a three-layer architecture (Routers → Operations → Database).

> **Attribution:** The principles, patterns, and architectural approach in this skill are inspired by and synthesized from [Arjan Codes](https://www.arjancodes.com/)' courses: *The Software Designer Mindset*, *Pythonic Patterns*, and *Complete Extension*. The specific Pythonic framing (Protocol-based DI, functional pattern progression, three-layer FastAPI architecture) originates from his teaching. This skill distills those principles into actionable guidance — it is not a reproduction of course content. See also: [github.com/arjancodes](https://github.com/arjancodes) | [youtube.com/arjancodes](https://www.youtube.com/arjancodes).

## When to Apply

- Scaffolding new FastAPI projects with clean separation of concerns
- Refactoring existing Python code to reduce coupling and increase cohesion
- Adding new components (endpoints, use cases, repositories, models)
- Reviewing code for design quality and Pythonic idiom adherence
- Making code testable through dependency injection and Protocol-based abstractions

## Core Architecture: Three Layers

Every FastAPI project follows a strict three-layer dependency flow:

```
Routers (API layer)  →  Operations (business logic)  →  Database (persistence)
```

Each layer depends ONLY on the layer below it. Never skip layers.

### Layer Responsibilities

**Routers** — HTTP interface. Accept requests, call operations, return responses. No business logic. Act as the composition root where concrete implementations are injected.

**Operations** — Business logic. Accept a `DataInterface` (Protocol) parameter for data access. Compute derived values, enforce rules, orchestrate workflows. Never import database modules directly.

**Database** — Persistence. Implement the `DataInterface` Protocol using SQLAlchemy, file storage, or any backend. Expose `read_by_id`, `read_all`, `create`, `update`, `delete` methods. Return `DataObject = dict[str, Any]` to decouple from ORM models.

### The DataInterface Protocol

```python
from typing import Any, Protocol

DataObject = dict[str, Any]

class DataInterface(Protocol):
    def read_by_id(self, id: str) -> DataObject: ...
    def read_all(self) -> list[DataObject]: ...
    def create(self, data: DataObject) -> DataObject: ...
    def update(self, id: str, data: DataObject) -> DataObject: ...
    def delete(self, id: str) -> None: ...
```

Operations accept `data_interface: DataInterface` as a parameter. The router passes the concrete implementation. This is dependency injection — no ABC inheritance needed.

### Pydantic Models

Define separate Create and Read models per entity:

```python
class CustomerCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str

class Customer(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    email: str
```

Use `**data.model_dump()` to unpack Pydantic models into DataObject dicts. Use `exclude_none=True` on update models for partial updates.

## Seven Design Principles

When writing or reviewing code, apply these principles in order of priority:

1. **High Cohesion** — Each class/function has a single responsibility. Extract class when a class does two things. Extract function when a function does two things.
2. **Low Coupling** — Minimize dependencies. Move methods to the class that owns the data (Information Expert). Pass only what a function needs.
3. **Depend on Abstractions** — Use `Protocol` for structural typing and `Callable` type aliases for function injection. Patterns emerge from good abstraction.
4. **Composition over Inheritance** — Extract shared behavior into standalone classes with a Protocol interface. Use `list[PaymentSource]` patterns. Never use mixins.
5. **Separate Creation from Use** — One composition root (the router or main function). Dictionary mapping over if/elif chains. Creator functions for complex construction.
6. **Start with the Data** — Fix data structures first; methods and layers follow. Extract domain classes from prefixed fields. Eliminate parallel lists.
7. **Keep Things Simple** — DRY (but avoid hasty abstractions). KISS (simplest design that works). YAGNI (implement only what is needed now).

## Pythonic Pattern Selection

When encountering these code smells, apply the corresponding pattern:

| Code Smell | Pattern | Pythonic Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Long if/elif switching behavior | Strategy | `Callable` type alias, pass functions as args |
| Need to create objects from config/JSON | Registry | `dict[str, Callable]` mapping + `**kwargs` unpacking |
| Event/notification side effects mixed with core logic | Pub/Sub | `subscribe(event, handler)` / `post_event(event, data)` dict-based |
| Duplicated algorithm across classes | Template Method | Extract to free function + Protocol parameter |
| Two independent hierarchies that vary | Bridge | `Callable` type alias replaces abstract reference |
| Need undo/batch/queue operations | Command | Functions returning undo closures |
| Object creation coupled to usage | Abstract Factory | Tuples of functions + `functools.partial` |
| Sequential data transformations | Pipeline | `functools.reduce` for composition, or framework `.pipe()` |
| Need to react to events without coupling | Callback | Function passed as argument, called when event occurs |
| Reusing a function with a different interface | Function Wrapper | Calls another function, translates its arguments |
| Separating configuration from usage | Function Builder | Higher-order function returns a configured function |
| Bare primitives for domain concepts (prices, emails) | Value Objects | Subclass built-in types with `__new__` validation, or frozen dataclass |
| Need audit trail, temporal queries, or event replay | Event Sourcing | Immutable `Event[T]`, append-only `EventStore[T]`, projection functions |
| Read/write patterns diverge; list views compute derived fields | CQRS | Separate write model + read projection, projector function after writes |
| Complex object with many optional parts | Builder | Fluent API with `Self` return type, `.build()` returns frozen product |
| Multiple DB writes that must succeed or fail together | Unit of Work | Context manager wrapping transaction: commit on success, rollback on error |
| Need exactly one instance of a shared resource | Singleton | Module-level instance (preferred), or metaclass with `_instances` dict |
| Object behaves differently depending on internal state | State | Protocol-based state objects, context delegates to current state |
| Incompatible interface from external library | Adapter | Protocol interface + `functools.partial` for single-method adaptation |
| Client coupled to complex subsystem details | Facade | Simplified interface class, `functools.partial` to bind dependencies |
| Transient failures in external API/DB calls | Retry | `@retry` decorator with exponential backoff, fallback strategies |
| Slow startup loading unused resources | Lazy Loading | `functools.cache`, TTL cache, generators, background preloading |
| Data access logic mixed into domain classes | Repository | Protocol interface for CRUD, concrete implementations per backend |
| Sequential operations on an object are verbose and error-prone | Fluent Interface | Methods return `self` for chaining, domain-specific verbs |
| Need extensibility without modifying core code | Plugin Architecture | Config-driven creation, `importlib` auto-discovery, self-registering modules |

### Default preferences for all patterns:

- **Protocol over ABC** — unless shared state in the superclass is needed
- **`functools.partial`** — to configure generic functions rather than creating wrapper classes
- **Closures** — to separate configuration-time args from runtime args
- **Don't go full functional** — find the happy medium; readability is the ultimate arbiter

## Scaffolding a New Project

When asked to create a new FastAPI project, generate this structure:

```
project_name/
├── main.py                    # FastAPI app, include_router, lifespan handler
├── routers/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── {entity}.py            # APIRouter, endpoint functions
├── operations/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── interface.py           # DataInterface Protocol + DataInterfaceStub
│   └── {entity}.py            # Business logic functions
├── db/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── database.py            # Engine, SessionLocal, Base
│   ├── db_interface.py        # Generic DBInterface class
│   └── models.py              # SQLAlchemy models
├── models/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── {entity}.py            # Pydantic Create/Read models
├── tests/
│   └── test_{entity}.py       # Tests using DataInterfaceStub
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore
```

## Testing Strategy

Create a `DataInterfaceStub` base class that stores data in a plain dict. Override specific methods in test-specific subclasses. Pass the stub to operations functions — no database needed.

```python
from typing import Any

DataObject = dict[str, Any]

class DataInterfaceStub:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data: dict[str, DataObject] = {}
    def read_by_id(self, id: str) -> DataObject:
        if id not in self.data:
            raise KeyError(f"Not found: {id}")
        return self.data[id]
    def read_all(self) -> list[DataObject]:
        return list(self.data.values())
    def create(self, data: DataObject) -> DataObject:
        self.data[data["id"]] = data
        return data
    def update(self, id: str, data: DataObject) -> DataObject:
        if id not in self.data:
            raise KeyError(f"Not found: {id}")
        self.data[id].update(data)
        return self.data[id]
    def delete(self, id: str) -> None:
        if id not in self.data:
            raise KeyError(f"Not found: {id}")
        del self.data[id]
```

## Workflows

The following workflows are available. The user can request any of these by name or by describing what they need.

---

### Review Architecture

**Trigger:** User asks to "review architecture", "review my code", "check code structure", or similar.

**Input:** A file or directory path (default: current working directory).

Before starting the review, ask the user: "Which review depth?" with options:
1. **Standard** — Reviews against built-in checklists. No extra file loading.
2. **In-depth** — Loads detailed reference files for deeper analysis with refactoring recipes and pattern guidance.

#### Review Process

1. **Read the code** — Find and read ALL Python files in the target path recursively. Read every `.py` file — do not skip any. Understand the project structure, imports, and relationships between files.

2. **Check architecture layers** — Verify the three-layer separation:
   - Routers (API) → Operations (business logic) → Database (persistence)
   - No layer skipping (routers should not import DB modules directly)
   - Operations accept `DataInterface` Protocol, not concrete DB classes
   - Router acts as composition root (wires concrete implementations)

3. **Check the 7 design principles** — For each file/class/function, evaluate:
   - **High Cohesion** — Does each unit have a single responsibility?
   - **Low Coupling** — Are dependencies minimized? Any Law of Demeter violations?
   - **Depend on Abstractions** — Protocol/Callable used for DI? Or concrete imports?
   - **Composition over Inheritance** — Any deep hierarchies or mixins?
   - **Separate Creation from Use** — One composition root? Dict mapping over if/elif?
   - **Start with the Data** — Prefixed fields? Parallel lists? Methods far from data?
   - **Keep Things Simple** — Over-engineered? Speculative features? Unnecessary abstractions?

4. **Check code quality** — Apply the 22 design rules:
   - No type abuse, vague identifiers, flag parameters, deep nesting
   - Tell don't ask, no parallel data structures, no god classes
   - No broad exception catching, no mutable defaults, no wildcard imports
   - Type hints on all functions, enums for fixed options, context managers for resources

5. **Check Pythonic patterns** — Are patterns implemented the Pythonic way?
   - Strategy as Callable, not ABC hierarchy
   - Factory as dict mapping, not if/elif
   - Protocol over ABC (unless shared state needed)
   - functools.partial for configuration, closures for builders
   - Pub/Sub for notification side effects, not inline calls
   - Registry for data-driven object creation, not if/elif
   - Context managers for resource management, not try/finally
   - Custom exception classes, not broad except catching
   - Dataclasses for value objects and DTOs, not manual __init__
   - Pure functions where possible, side effects pushed to boundaries

6. **Check code cleanup opportunities** — Look for concrete refactoring targets:
   - Extract class when a class does two things
   - Extract function when a function does two things
   - Replace mutable globals with injected dataclass context
   - Replace boolean flag parameters with separate functions
   - Replace string constants with Enums
   - Replace deep nesting (3+ levels) with early returns or extraction
   - Replace god classes (>200 lines, >5 responsibilities) with collaborators
   - Move methods to the class that owns the data (Information Expert)
   - Replace parallel data structures with a single data class
   - Replace if/elif chains with dict mapping

7. **Report findings** — Structure the output in this order:

   #### Architecture Summary
   Classify every Python file into a layer, then show the dependency flows. Use a simple vertical list format — never multi-column ASCII art. Example:

   ```
   Layers
   ──────
   API:        routes/booking.py, routes/customer.py
   Logic:      operations/booking.py, operations/customer.py
   Database:   db/db_interface.py, db/models.py, db/database.py
   Unclear:    utils/helpers.py (mixed concerns)

   Dependency Flows
   ────────────────
   routes/booking.py → operations/booking.py → db/db_interface.py    ✓
   routes/customer.py → operations/customer.py → db/db_interface.py  ✓
   routes/admin.py → db/models.py                                    ⚠ layer skip

   Layer Violations
   ────────────────
   ⚠ routes/admin.py imports db/models.py directly — should go through operations
   ```

   Adapt to the actual project. If it does not follow the three-layer model, show the dependency flow as-is and note what a target architecture would look like. Keep it compact.

   #### What Works Well
   Call out specific things the code does right. Reference files and patterns. Be specific — cite actual files and lines, not generic praise.

   #### Findings by Severity
   Present issues organized by severity:
   - **Critical** — Layer violations, missing abstractions, tight coupling to concrete DB
   - **Important** — Cohesion issues, Law of Demeter violations, missing type hints
   - **Suggestions** — Pattern improvements, naming, simplification opportunities, cleanup refactorings

   For each finding, include all of the following:
   1. **File and line** — exact location
   2. **Principle(s)** — which of the 7 design principles are violated, by number and name (e.g., "P1 High Cohesion", "P3 Depend on Abstractions"). Can be more than one.
   3. **Pattern** — if a Pythonic design pattern would help, name it
   4. **Fix** — show the recommended fix with a code snippet

#### In-Depth Mode

If the user chose in-depth, load the following reference files for deeper analysis with detailed refactoring recipes and pattern guidance:
- `references/design-principles.md`
- `references/code-quality.md`
- `references/error-handling.md`
- `references/pythonic-patterns.md`

For detailed pattern guidance (when explaining HOW to fix), consult the relevant files in `references/patterns/`.

If the user chose standard, use only the checklists above — do not load reference files.

---

### Check Quality

**Trigger:** User asks to "check quality", "check code quality", "run quality check", or similar.

**Input:** A file or directory path (default: current working directory).

Run a focused code quality check against the 22 design rules. This is a lighter, faster check than a full architecture review.

#### Process

1. **Read the code** — Find and read ALL Python files in the target path recursively.

2. **Check the 22 rules** — For each file, check:

   **Naming & Structure:**
   1. No type abuse (don't embed type in name: `user_list` → `users`)
   2. No vague identifiers (`data`, `info`, `temp`, `result`, `handle`)
   3. No single-letter variables outside comprehensions and lambdas
   4. No abbreviations (`cfg` → `config`, `mgr` → `manager`)

   **Functions:**
   5. No flag parameters (boolean args that switch behavior → split into two functions)
   6. No deep nesting (3+ levels → early returns or extract function)
   7. Tell don't ask (don't query state then act on it — tell the object to act)
   8. Functions do one thing (extract if doing two things)

   **Classes:**
   9. No god classes (>200 lines or >5 responsibilities → extract classes)
   10. No parallel data structures (two lists tracking same entities → single dataclass)
   11. Information Expert (methods should live on the class that owns the data)

   **Types & Safety:**
   12. Type hints on all function signatures
   13. Enums for fixed option sets (not bare strings)
   14. No mutable default arguments (`def f(items=[])` → `def f(items=None)`)
   15. No wildcard imports (`from x import *`)

   **Error Handling:**
   16. No broad exception catching (`except Exception` → catch specific exceptions)
   17. Context managers for resources (`with open()` not manual try/finally)

3. **Report findings** — For each violation:
   - **Rule number and name**
   - **File and line**
   - **Fix** — short code snippet showing the correction

   Group by file for easy navigation. Show a summary count at the top:
   ```
   Quality Check: 14 files scanned, 8 issues found
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Rule 6  (deep nesting):     3 instances
   Rule 12 (missing types):    2 instances
   Rule 16 (broad except):     2 instances
   Rule 5  (flag parameter):   1 instance
   ```

---

### Suggest Patterns

**Trigger:** User asks to "suggest patterns", "recommend patterns", "what patterns should I use", or similar.

**Input:** A file or directory path (default: current working directory).

Scan the code and recommend which of the 25 Pythonic design patterns would improve it.

#### Process

1. **Read the code** — Find and read ALL Python files in the target path recursively.

2. **Match code smells to patterns** — Look for these specific smells:

   | Code Smell | Pattern | Pythonic Implementation |
   |---|---|---|
   | Long if/elif switching behavior | **Strategy** | `Callable` type alias, pass functions as args |
   | Need to create families of related objects | **Abstract Factory** | Tuples of functions + `functools.partial` |
   | Two independent hierarchies that vary | **Bridge** | `Callable` type alias replaces abstract reference |
   | Need undo/batch/queue operations | **Command** | Functions returning undo closures |
   | Side effects mixed with core logic | **Pub/Sub** | Dict-based `subscribe(event, handler)` / `post_event()` |
   | Object creation from config/JSON data | **Registry** | `dict[str, Callable]` mapping + `**kwargs` unpacking |
   | Same algorithm duplicated across classes | **Template Method** | Free function + Protocol parameter |
   | Sequential data transformations | **Pipeline** | `functools.reduce` for composition |
   | Need to react to events without coupling | **Callback** | Function passed as argument |
   | Reusing a function with a different interface | **Function Wrapper** | Wraps another function, translates args |
   | Separating configuration from usage | **Function Builder** | Higher-order function returns configured function |

3. **Report suggestions** — For each match, show:
   - **File and line** — where the smell is
   - **Code smell** — what makes this a candidate
   - **Pattern** — which pattern applies and why
   - **Before** — current code snippet
   - **After** — refactored code using the Pythonic implementation
   - **Trade-off** — is the refactoring worth it here? (sometimes the simple version is fine)

4. **Prioritize** — Order suggestions by impact. A pattern that simplifies 50 lines beats one that saves 3 lines. Note when the current code is simple enough that applying a pattern would be over-engineering.

For full pattern progressions (OOP → functional), consult `references/patterns/`.

---

### Decouple

**Trigger:** User asks to "decouple", "find coupling", "reduce coupling", "improve dependency injection", or similar.

**Input:** A file or directory path (default: current working directory).

Analyze the code for tight coupling and suggest how to decouple using dependency injection.

#### Process

1. **Read the code** — Find and read ALL Python files in the target path recursively. Read every `.py` file. Map imports between modules.

2. **Identify coupling issues** — Look for:
   - **Concrete imports** — modules importing concrete classes instead of depending on abstractions
   - **Global mutable state** — module-level variables shared across files
   - **Content coupling** — accessing private members (`_var`) of other modules
   - **Law of Demeter violations** — chained attribute access (`a.b.c.method()`)
   - **Circular imports** — two modules importing each other
   - **God modules** — one module imported by nearly everything
   - **Missing composition root** — object creation scattered across multiple files instead of one place
   - **Hard-coded dependencies** — `import` inside functions, direct instantiation instead of injection

3. **Generate dependency map** — Show which modules depend on which:
   ```
   Module Dependencies
   ───────────────────
   routes/booking.py → operations/booking.py, models/booking.py
   operations/booking.py → models/booking.py  (no DB import ✓)
   routes/admin.py → db/models.py             ⚠ concrete DB import
   ```

4. **Propose decoupling** — For each issue, show:
   - **File and line**
   - **Principle violated** — which of the 7 design principles (P1–P7)
   - **Current coupling** — what the code does now
   - **Decoupled version** — using Protocol, Callable, or composition root
   - **Before/after code**

5. **Ask before applying** — Confirm which changes to apply before editing any files.

6. **Apply changes** — Edit the files with the approved decoupling.

For guidance on Protocol-based DI, consult `references/layered-architecture.md` and `references/design-principles.md`.

---

### Make Pythonic

**Trigger:** User asks to "make pythonic", "make it pythonic", "refactor to pythonic", "use pythonic patterns", or similar.

**Input:** A file or directory path (default: current working directory).

Analyze code and apply Pythonic pattern replacements.

#### Process

1. **Read the code** — Find and read ALL Python files in the target path recursively. Read every `.py` file.

2. **Identify non-Pythonic patterns** — Look for these specific code smells:

   | Code Smell | Replace With |
   |---|---|
   | ABC/abstract base class hierarchy | Protocol (structural typing) |
   | Single-method abstract class | `Callable` type alias |
   | Deep class inheritance / mixins | Composition with Protocol interface |
   | Wrapper classes for configuration | `functools.partial` |
   | Factory class hierarchies | Closures or tuples of functions + `partial` |
   | Long if/elif switching behavior | Strategy pattern — pass functions as args |
   | if/elif for object creation | Registry pattern — `dict[str, Callable]` mapping |
   | Inline notification side effects | Pub/Sub — `subscribe(event, handler)` / `post_event()` |
   | Duplicated algorithm across classes | Template Method — free function + Protocol parameter |
   | try/finally for resource cleanup | Context managers |
   | Manual `__init__` for data holders | `@dataclass` |
   | Bare string constants for options | `Enum` or `StrEnum` |

3. **Propose changes** — For each finding, show:
   - **File and line**
   - **Current pattern** — what it does now
   - **Pythonic replacement** — what it should become
   - **Before/after code** — complete snippets ready to apply

4. **Ask before applying** — Confirm before editing. Let the user review.

5. **Apply changes** — Edit the files with the approved refactorings.

For detailed pattern guidance, consult the relevant files in `references/patterns/`.

---

### Extract God Class

**Trigger:** User asks to "extract god class", "split large class", "break up class", or similar.

**Input:** A file or directory path (default: current working directory).

Analyze code for god classes and generate the split.

#### Process

1. **Read the code** — Find and read ALL Python files in the target path recursively. Read every `.py` file.

2. **Identify god classes** — A class is a god class if it has any of:
   - More than 200 lines
   - More than 5 distinct responsibilities
   - Methods that cluster into unrelated groups
   - Too many instance variables (>7)
   - Methods that don't use most of the class's state

3. **Analyze responsibilities** — For each god class:
   - Group methods by the data they access and the responsibility they serve
   - Identify natural boundaries between responsibilities
   - Determine which methods belong together
   - Name each responsibility group

4. **Propose extraction** — Show:
   - **Original class** — file, line count, responsibilities found
   - **Proposed split** — one new class per responsibility group with:
     - Class name
     - Methods it takes
     - Its `__init__` parameters
     - Complete code for the new class
   - **Updated original** — the slimmed-down class that composes the extracted ones
   - **Updated callers** — any files that need import changes

5. **Ask before applying** — Confirm the split. The user may want to adjust which methods go where.

6. **Apply changes** — Create the new files and update the original class and its callers.

Principles: P1 High Cohesion, P4 Composition over Inheritance. Consult `references/design-principles.md` for refactoring recipes.

---

### Scaffold API

**Trigger:** User asks to "scaffold API", "scaffold FastAPI", "create a new FastAPI project", "generate project", or similar.

**Input:** A project name.

Generate a new FastAPI project with the three-layer clean architecture structure.

#### Process

1. **Ask for entities** — Ask the user: "What are the main entities for this API? (e.g., users, products, orders)" to determine what to scaffold.

2. **Create project structure** — Generate the full directory tree:

   ```
   {project_name}/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── main.py                  # FastAPI app, include_router, startup
   │   ├── routers/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   └── {entity}.py          # APIRouter, endpoints, composition root
   │   ├── operations/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   └── {entity}.py          # Business logic, accepts DataInterface
   │   ├── db/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   ├── database.py          # Engine, SessionLocal, Base
   │   │   ├── db_interface.py      # Generic DBInterface implementing DataInterface
   │   │   └── models.py            # SQLAlchemy ORM models
   │   └── models/
   │       ├── __init__.py
   │       └── {entity}.py          # Pydantic models + DataInterface Protocol
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── test_{entity}.py         # Tests using DataInterfaceStub
   ├── requirements.txt
   └── .gitignore
   ```

3. **Generate files** — For each entity, create:
   - **Pydantic models** — separate Create and Read models + `DataInterface` Protocol
   - **Operations** — business logic functions accepting `data_interface: DataInterface`
   - **Router** — CRUD endpoints acting as composition root, injecting concrete DB
   - **DB model** — SQLAlchemy ORM model
   - **Tests** — using `DataInterfaceStub` with no database dependency

4. **Wire it together** — `main.py` includes all routers and sets up the database.

Consult `references/layered-architecture.md` and `references/testable-api.md` for the full architecture patterns. Use `assets/fastapi-hotel-api/` as a working reference.

---

### Add Endpoint

**Trigger:** User asks to "add endpoint", "add a new endpoint", "add entity", "add a router", or similar.

**Input:** An entity name.

Scaffold a new endpoint across all three layers of the clean architecture.

#### Process

1. **Understand the project** — Read the existing project structure to understand naming conventions, existing patterns, and where files live. Identify the routers/, operations/, db/, and models/ directories.

2. **Ask for details** — Ask the user: "What operations does this endpoint need?" with options: CRUD (all), Read-only, Custom (describe).

3. **Generate across all layers** — Create or update files in each layer:

   **Models layer** (`models/{entity}.py`):
   - `{Entity}Create` — Pydantic model for creation input
   - `{Entity}` — Pydantic model for read output (includes id)
   - `{Entity}Update` — Pydantic model for partial updates (all fields optional)
   - `DataInterface` Protocol if not already defined, or extend existing one

   **Operations layer** (`operations/{entity}.py`):
   - Business logic functions that accept `data_interface: DataInterface`
   - `create_{entity}()`, `get_{entity}()`, `list_{entities}()`, `update_{entity}()`, `delete_{entity}()`
   - No database imports — only depends on the Protocol

   **Database layer** (`db/models.py`):
   - SQLAlchemy ORM model for the entity
   - Extend `DBInterface` if using generic implementation, or add methods to existing DB class

   **Router layer** (`routers/{entity}.py`):
   - `APIRouter` with CRUD endpoints
   - Acts as composition root — instantiates/injects concrete DB into operations
   - Proper HTTP methods and status codes (201 for create, 204 for delete)

   **Tests** (`tests/test_{entity}.py`):
   - Tests using `DataInterfaceStub` — no database needed
   - Cover create, read, update, delete, and not-found cases

4. **Update main.py** — Add `include_router()` for the new router.

Follow existing project conventions for naming, imports, and style. Consult `references/layered-architecture.md` for the layer patterns.
