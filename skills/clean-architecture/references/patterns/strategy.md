# Strategy Pattern

A strategy is a higher-order function. The classic OOP version wraps that idea in classes, but Python lets the pattern shed its ceremony and become what it always was: passing a function to another function.

## 1. Problem

An `if/elif/else` chain selects between different behavioral logic inside a method. Each branch is a separate algorithm, but they are all tangled together in one place.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Order:
    price: int
    quantity: int

    def compute_total(self, discount_type: str) -> int:
        if discount_type == "percentage":
            discount = int(self.price * self.quantity * 0.20)
        elif discount_type == "fixed":
            discount = 10_00
        else:
            discount = 0
        return self.price * self.quantity - discount


def main() -> None:
    order = Order(price=100_00, quantity=2)
    print(order)
    print(f"Total: ${order.compute_total('percentage') / 100:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### What is wrong

| Smell | Why it hurts |
|---|---|
| `discount_type` is a raw string | No compile-time validation; typos fail silently |
| Growing `if/elif` chain | Every new discount type forces a change to `compute_total` (violates Open-Closed) |
| Magic numbers (`0.20`, `10_00`) | No way to configure the percentage or fixed amount without adding more parameters |
| Mixed responsibilities | `Order` knows both how to represent an order AND how to compute every kind of discount (low cohesion) |

---

## 2. Simplest Solution: Dict Lookup

Before reaching for classes or callables, check if the if/elif chain is just mapping keys to values. If so, a dict is all you need.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

DISCOUNT_RATES: dict[str, float] = {
    "percentage": 0.20,
    "fixed_ten": 10_00,
}


@dataclass
class Order:
    price: int
    quantity: int

    def compute_total(self, discount_type: str) -> int:
        discount = DISCOUNT_RATES.get(discount_type, 0)
        return self.price * self.quantity - discount


def main() -> None:
    order = Order(price=100_00, quantity=2)
    print(f"Total: ${order.compute_total('percentage') / 100:.2f}")
```

This eliminates the if/elif chain with a single dict lookup. It's readable, testable, and easy to extend — add a new key to the dict and you're done.

### When dict lookup is enough

- Each branch maps to a **value** (a number, a string, a config), not a **behavior**
- All branches have the same shape (same type of result)
- No complex logic per branch — just data selection

### When you need more

- Each branch has **different logic**, not just different values
- Branches need access to runtime state (e.g., the order price)
- You need to compose or chain strategies

If you need actual behavior selection, continue to the solutions below.

## 3. OOP Solution

Introduce an abstract `DiscountStrategy` class. Each branch becomes a concrete subclass. `Order` depends only on the abstraction.

### With ABC

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from dataclasses import dataclass


class DiscountStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def compute(self, price: int) -> int:
        """Compute the discount for the given price."""


class PercentageDiscount(DiscountStrategy):
    def compute(self, price: int) -> int:
        return int(price * 0.20)


class FixedDiscount(DiscountStrategy):
    def compute(self, price: int) -> int:
        return 10_00


@dataclass
class Order:
    price: int
    quantity: int
    discount: DiscountStrategy

    def compute_total(self) -> int:
        discount = self.discount.compute(self.price * self.quantity)
        return self.price * self.quantity - discount


def main() -> None:
    order = Order(price=100_00, quantity=2, discount=PercentageDiscount())
    print(order)
    print(f"Total: ${order.compute_total() / 100:.2f}")
    # Output: Total: $160.00
```

`Order` no longer knows which discount type it receives. Swap `PercentageDiscount()` for `FixedDiscount()` and `Order` never changes.

### With Protocol

Replace ABC with a Protocol to drop the inheritance relationship entirely. Subclasses no longer need to inherit from anything -- they just need a matching `compute` method (duck typing).

```python
from typing import Protocol
from dataclasses import dataclass


class DiscountStrategy(Protocol):
    def compute(self, price: int) -> int: ...


class PercentageDiscount:
    def compute(self, price: int) -> int:
        return int(price * 0.20)


class FixedDiscount:
    def compute(self, price: int) -> int:
        return 10_00


@dataclass
class Order:
    price: int
    quantity: int
    discount: DiscountStrategy

    def compute_total(self) -> int:
        discount = self.discount.compute(self.price * self.quantity)
        return self.price * self.quantity - discount
```

Both ABC and Protocol achieve the same decoupling. For the Strategy pattern specifically, either works — it comes down to preference. Protocol is a natural fit when there is no shared implementation in the base class. ABC is better when strategies share state or helper methods in the base class, or when you want instantiation-time error checking. See the full comparison in `references/design-principles.md`.

### What this solves

- **Increases cohesion** -- `Order` only represents price/quantity and delegates discount logic.
- **Reduces coupling** -- `Order` depends on the abstraction, not on `PercentageDiscount` or `FixedDiscount` directly.
- **Open for extension** -- add a new discount type without touching `Order`.

### What remains unsolved

Magic numbers (`0.20`, `10_00`) are still hardcoded inside each strategy class. Configuration comes next.

## 4. Pythonic Progression

### Step A: Callable type alias replaces the abstract class

Each strategy class has only one method. In Python, a class with a single method is a function waiting to get out. Define a `Callable` type alias and use `__call__` to make strategy objects callable.

```python
from typing import Callable
from dataclasses import dataclass

DiscountFunction = Callable[[int], int]


class PercentageDiscount:
    def __call__(self, price: int) -> int:
        return int(price * 0.20)


class FixedDiscount:
    def __call__(self, price: int) -> int:
        return 10_00


@dataclass
class Order:
    price: int
    quantity: int
    discount: DiscountFunction

    def compute_total(self) -> int:
        discount = self.discount(self.price * self.quantity)
        return max(0, self.price * self.quantity - discount)
```

The abstraction is now a **type** (`Callable[[int], int]`), not a class hierarchy. Any callable matching that signature works -- a class with `__call__`, a plain function, a lambda. The Protocol class and the ABC are both gone.

### Step B: Configurable callable classes (solving magic numbers)

Turn the strategy classes into dataclasses that accept their configuration at construction time.

```python
from typing import Callable
from dataclasses import dataclass

DiscountFunction = Callable[[int], int]


@dataclass
class PercentageDiscount:
    percentage: float

    def __call__(self, price: int) -> int:
        return int(price * self.percentage)


@dataclass
class FixedDiscount:
    fixed: int

    def __call__(self, price: int) -> int:
        return self.fixed


@dataclass
class Order:
    price: int
    quantity: int
    discount: DiscountFunction

    def compute_total(self) -> int:
        discount = self.discount(self.price * self.quantity)
        return max(0, self.price * self.quantity - discount)


def main() -> None:
    order = Order(price=100_00, quantity=2, discount=PercentageDiscount(0.30))
    print(f"Total: ${order.compute_total() / 100:.2f}")
    # Output: Total: $140.00 (30% discount on $200)
```

Magic numbers are gone. Configuration is injected at object creation. `Order` still sees only `DiscountFunction` and never changes.

### Step C: Plain functions

Since each strategy class is really just one function, drop the class entirely.

```python
from typing import Callable
from dataclasses import dataclass

DiscountFunction = Callable[[int], int]


def percentage_discount(price: int) -> int:
    return int(price * 0.20)


def fixed_discount(price: int) -> int:
    return 10_00


@dataclass
class Order:
    price: int
    quantity: int
    discount: DiscountFunction

    def compute_total(self) -> int:
        discount = self.discount(self.price * self.quantity)
        return max(0, self.price * self.quantity - discount)


def main() -> None:
    order = Order(price=100_00, quantity=2, discount=percentage_discount)
    print(f"Total: ${order.compute_total() / 100:.2f}")
    # Output: Total: $160.00
```

The `Order` initializer is now a **higher-order function** -- it receives another function as an argument. The strategy pattern, at its core, is exactly this.

But the magic numbers are back. The function signature is `(int) -> int`, so there is no room for a configuration parameter without breaking the type alias.

### Step D: Closures (function builder)

Wrap the strategy in a builder function that captures configuration in a closure and returns a function matching `DiscountFunction`.

```python
from typing import Callable
from dataclasses import dataclass

DiscountFunction = Callable[[int], int]


def percentage_discount(percentage: float) -> DiscountFunction:
    return lambda price: int(price * percentage)


def fixed_discount(fixed: int) -> DiscountFunction:
    return lambda price: fixed


@dataclass
class Order:
    price: int
    quantity: int
    discount: DiscountFunction

    def compute_total(self) -> int:
        discount = self.discount(self.price * self.quantity)
        return max(0, self.price * self.quantity - discount)


def main() -> None:
    order = Order(price=100_00, quantity=2, discount=percentage_discount(0.15))
    print(f"Total: ${order.compute_total() / 100:.2f}")
    # Output: Total: $170.00 (15% discount on $200)
```

`percentage_discount(0.15)` does not compute a discount -- it **builds a function** that computes a 15% discount. The returned function matches `Callable[[int], int]` exactly.

The closure approach separates **configuration-time arguments** (percentage) from **runtime arguments** (price). This is the function builder pattern -- the builder's parameters can be completely different from the returned function's parameters.

### Step E: functools.partial

When the configuration arguments and the runtime arguments belong to the same function (no need for separate builder parameters), use `functools.partial` to pre-apply some arguments.

```python
from functools import partial
from typing import Callable
from dataclasses import dataclass

DiscountFunction = Callable[[int], int]


def percentage_discount(price: int, percentage: float) -> int:
    return int(price * percentage)


def fixed_discount(price: int, fixed: int) -> int:
    return fixed


@dataclass
class Order:
    price: int
    quantity: int
    discount: DiscountFunction

    def compute_total(self) -> int:
        discount = self.discount(self.price * self.quantity)
        return max(0, self.price * self.quantity - discount)


def main() -> None:
    perc_discount = partial(percentage_discount, percentage=0.12)
    order = Order(price=100_00, quantity=2, discount=perc_discount)
    print(f"Total: ${order.compute_total() / 100:.2f}")
    # Output: Total: $176.00 (12% discount on $200)
```

`partial(percentage_discount, percentage=0.12)` returns a new callable that only needs `price`. The configuration argument has already been supplied.

## 5. When to Use

Recognize these signals in existing code:

- **Long `if/elif/else` chain** where each branch does a variation of the same thing (different discount calculation, different sorting algorithm, different validation rule).
- **A method with a `type` or `mode` string/enum parameter** that selects between different logic paths.
- **Growing parameter lists** -- each new variant adds parameters that only apply to that variant.
- **Duplicated logic across methods** that differ only in a small behavioral step.
- **Need to swap behavior at runtime** -- the caller decides which algorithm to use.

Confirm by asking: "Does this function do different things depending on a flag, and will there be more options in the future?" If yes, extract a strategy.

---

## 6. Trade-offs

### When each approach is appropriate

| Approach | Use when... | Avoid when... |
|---|---|---|
| **Dict lookup** | Branches map keys to values (numbers, strings, configs), not behavior | Each branch has different logic or needs runtime state |
| **ABC** | Strategies share instance variables or helper methods in the base class | The strategy is a single method with no shared state |
| **Protocol** | Third-party code must satisfy the strategy interface without modification | Shared base implementation is needed |
| **Callable type alias** | Strategy is a single function; maximum flexibility wanted | Strategy requires multiple cooperating methods |
| **Closure / function builder** | Configuration args differ in kind from runtime args; need to build specialized functions | Simple parameter pre-binding suffices |
| **`functools.partial`** | Configuration args are a subset of the function's regular parameters | Config and runtime args are conceptually different; typing precision matters |

### Practical gotchas

- **`functools.partial` and type checkers.** Pylance and mypy infer `partial[int]` for the return type, losing the full callable signature. The type checker cannot verify that the partially-applied function matches `DiscountFunction`. Accept this limitation or use a closure instead when type safety is critical.
- **Lambda readability.** A single-line lambda in a closure is fine. Multi-line logic belongs in a named inner function (`def compute_discount(price: int) -> int:`), not a lambda.
- **Callable classes still have a role.** When a strategy needs configuration stored as instance variables (e.g., `PercentageDiscount(percentage=0.15)`) or mutable state between invocations (counter, cache), a dataclass with `__call__` is cleaner than a closure with `nonlocal` variables. See "When to Convert a Single-Method Class to a Function" in `references/function-design.md` for the full decision criteria.
- **Do not over-extract.** A two-branch `if/else` that will never grow does not need a strategy pattern. Apply KISS -- only introduce the pattern when the branching is growing or the branches are complex.
- **Protocol vs Callable.** A `Protocol` with a single method and a `Callable` type alias are functionally equivalent in Python. Prefer the `Callable` alias for brevity. Use a `Protocol` when the method name carries important semantic meaning (e.g., `def validate(self, data: dict) -> bool`).
- **Strategy-specific parameters.** When different strategies need different configuration parameters, do not add all parameters to the shared interface. Each strategy should encapsulate its own configuration. A `PercentageDiscount` needs a `percentage` while a `FixedDiscount` needs a `fixed` amount — these are construction-time concerns, not part of the strategy interface. The `__call__` approach (Step B) or closure approach (Step D) handles this naturally.
- **The `__call__` step is underrated.** Step B (dataclass with `__call__`) is often the practical sweet spot. It gives you named configuration (`PercentageDiscount(percentage=0.15)`), inspectable state, and a callable that matches `Callable[[int], int]` — combining the best of classes and functions.

---

## 7. Related Patterns

- **Function Builder** -- a generalization of the closure approach (Step D). The builder function's parameters are completely independent from the returned function's parameters. Covered in the Function Builder pattern reference.
- **Abstract Factory** -- strategies that produce families of related objects. Often implemented as tuples of callables with `partial` for configuration.
- **Command** -- like strategy, replaces behavior with a callable, but focuses on storing, sequencing, and undoing operations rather than selecting algorithms.
- **Bridge** -- separates two independent dimensions of variation using `Callable` type aliases, where one dimension is passed as a strategy-like function argument.
- **Pipeline** -- chains multiple strategies in sequence using function composition (`functools.reduce`).
- **Registry** -- maps string keys to strategy functions, enabling dynamic selection from configuration files or user input.
