# MCP Threats Taxonomy

This document provides a comprehensive reference of all threat classifications used by the MCP Scanner, mapped to the standardized MCP Taxonomy framework.

## Overview

The MCP Scanner maps all detected threats to the MCP Taxonomy, which provides a standardized framework for classifying AI and agentic system security threats. Each finding includes:

- **Threat Name**: The specific threat detected by the analyzer
- **MCP Taxonomy Technique**: The technique ID and name from the MCP Taxonomy
- **MCP Taxonomy Sub-Technique**: The sub-technique ID and name
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the threat

## Threat Mappings by Analyzer

### LLM Analyzer Threats

| Threat Name | AITech ID | AITech Name | AISubtech ID | AISubtech Name | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| PROMPT INJECTION | AITech-1.1 | Direct Prompt Injection | AISubtech-1.1.1 | Instruction Manipulation (Direct Prompt Injection) | Adversarial attack that attempts to alter or control the output of a LLM or other related systems by providing instructions (via prompt) that override existing instructions and/or bypass model alignment or guardrails. A prompt injection technique is any transformation that preserves the intent of the input. |

## Accessing Taxonomy Information

### CLI Output

When using the CLI with `--detailed` flag, taxonomy information is displayed for each finding from all analyzers (YARA, LLM, and API):

```bash
# YARA analyzer with taxonomy
mcp-scanner --analyzers yara --detailed remote --server-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp

# LLM analyzer with taxonomy
mcp-scanner --analyzers llm --detailed remote --server-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp

# API analyzer with taxonomy
mcp-scanner --analyzers api --detailed remote --server-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
