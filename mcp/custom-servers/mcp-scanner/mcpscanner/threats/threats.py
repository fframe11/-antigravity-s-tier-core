Threat mapping from scanner threat names to MCP Taxonomy.

and the standardized MCP Taxonomy threat classifications.

The module is organized into two main sections:
1. THREAT DEFINITIONS: Complete threat definitions with taxonomy mappings and severity
2. SIMPLIFIED MAPPINGS & FUNCTIONS: Helper functions and lightweight mappings
