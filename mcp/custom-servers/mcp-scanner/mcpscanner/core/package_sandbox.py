"""Safe package-archive download & extraction for the no-Docker SDK path.

Docker remains the recommended sandbox for untrusted packages. When the SDK
caller explicitly opts out of Docker (``use_docker=False``) we still need to
download and extract a tarball on the host *without* giving the package a
chance to read/write outside the working directory or exhaust resources.

This module centralises that behaviour so PyPI and npm scanners share the
same defensive parsing path:

* HTTPS-only downloads to a temporary directory the caller owns.
* Streamed writes with an explicit byte cap (``PACKAGE_ARCHIVE_MAX_BYTES``).
* :mod:`tarfile` ``filter="data"`` extraction (available on every Python
  this project supports — the filter landed in 3.12 and was backported to
  3.11.4, which is our ``requires-python`` floor): drops symlinks,
  hardlinks, device files, absolute paths, and ``..`` traversal.
* Hard caps on total extracted bytes and file count to defend against
  zip-bombs.
* Digest verification with an allow-list of algorithms so a poisoned
  registry can't trick us into "verifying" against a broken hash.
* Archive bytes are streamed to a ``.partial`` sibling and only moved into
  place after integrity verification succeeds, so a tampered file never
  occupies its final filename even briefly.
* No code is *executed* from the package — we only read source files.

The local path is intentionally narrower than the Docker path: callers MUST
explicitly opt in by passing ``use_docker=False``.
