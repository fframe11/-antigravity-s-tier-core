"""Prompt Defense Analyzer module for MCP Scanner SDK.

This module checks MCP tool descriptions and system prompts for MISSING
defensive measures against 12 common attack vectors. It uses pure regex
pattern matching — no API key or external dependencies required.

Each check maps to MCP Taxonomy codes and produces a SecurityFinding
when the corresponding defense is absent from the scanned content.
